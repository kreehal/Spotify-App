        <b> Introduction: </b><br>
        In a world where personal data is becoming less and less private,
        we wanted to investigate the extent to which users' individual information
        was used by the private sector. Our website allows users to enter their own
        Spotify listening data, and receive a visualization of the insights that
        Spotify has the ability to collect. Our program is designed only to
        educate consumers, and does not store users' individual data. <br><br>

        <b> Our Product Journey: </b> <br>

      	We took each user’s recently played music, and separated
        it into distinct listening sessions, which we deemed to be
        any listening activity that had more than 10 songs,
        with sessions being separated by any breaks of 30 minutes or more.
        Once split into listening sessions, we assigned each song an emotional
        group. The assignment was based on an analysis of the song’s audio
        features in comparison with data we had previously obtained for that
        emotional group. From there, we were able to calculate summary statistics
        for each listening session, based on each song’s emotional group. <br>

      	Finally, we analyzed the summary statistics of each session in the context of prior research done on
        the relationship between mood and music choice. Basing our work off of previous findings, we developed
        a model that would predict user mood for each listening session, which we displayed alongside the
        summary statistics for user benefit. If you are interested in learning more about our research, data collection and analysis, or emotional analysis framework, you can find a detailed slideshow describing our work <a href="http://bit.ly/ethiTeam3">here</a>.
